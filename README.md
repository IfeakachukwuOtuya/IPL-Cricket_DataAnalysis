# Cricket Player Salary Analysis and Visualization
This project analyzes and visualizes the salaries of famous cricket players over several seasons (2010-2019). The analysis and plots are generated using Python, specifically using `numpy` for data handling and `matplotlib` for plotting the data.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used data for 10 cricket players and their salaries over 10 seasons. The primary goal of this project is to visualize how player salaries have changed over time. The analysis includes salary data and games played for each player, as well as the points they earned in each season.

# Data Used:
   Players: The data includes 10 popular cricket players:

    Sachin, Rahul, Smith, Sami, Pollard, Morris, Samson, Dhoni, Kohli, Sky

 Seasons: The data spans 10 seasons from 2010 to 2019.
 Metrics:

    Salary: Annual salary of each player for each season.
    Games: The number of games played by each player in each season.
    Points: The points accumulated by the players in each season.
  
# Key Features
   Visualization: Using matplotlib, I plotted the salary data for each player across the seasons. Different line styles, markers, and colors were used to differentiate each 
   player's salary plot.

   Dynamic Plotting: The plot is generated dynamically based on the player data, and the xticks are labeled with the corresponding seasons.

   Legend: The legend was positioned dynamically, ensuring that the plot remained clear even with many players.

# Technologies Used
   Python: The primary programming language used for data handling and visualization.
   NumPy: For handling numerical data and creating matrices of salary, games, and points.
   Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the data.
